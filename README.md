# Overview
In this project, I designed interactive dashboards using Power BI that focused on analyzing shipping operations and transportation costs within the order and sales cycle. The goal of the analysis is to improve shipping efficiency, track logistics performance, and help management make accurate, data-driven decisions.

# Project Features:
- Interactive design with an easy-to-use interface.
- Flexible navigation between analytical pages.
- Use of various charts to illustrate relationships between indicators.
- Ready to display on screens or export to PDF.

# Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- Total Freight Cost
- Number of Orders by Ship Method
- Demonstrating the impact of each shipping method on order volume and utilization rates.
- Freight Trends by Day Analysis
- Number of Years Covered
- Quantity Shipped
